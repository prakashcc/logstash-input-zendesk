# Logstash Input Plugin for Zendesk


**NOTE: I have made some changes in this plugin so it is working now with elastic 7.10 logstash version.If you are testing it on below 7.0 version it will work but i not 100% sure**

This input fetches data from Zendesk and generates Logstash events for indexing into Elasticsearch.
It uses the official Zendesk ruby client api (https://github.com/zendesk/zendesk_api_client_rb).  
Currently, the input supports organization, user, ticket, ticket comment and topic object types.  
It assumes that the user specified has the appropriate Zendesk permissions to access the fetched objects.
Don't forget to apply the index templates from the templates folder to Elasticsearch before running the plugin.

Just sharing what I have been using and I hope it helps other folks get started.

Disclaimer:  This is my first Ruby program :)

```
 Sample configuration:

 [source,ruby]
 ----------------------------------
     input 
     { 
       zendesk
       {
         domain => "company.zendesk.com"
         # Specify either user and password or user and api_token for authentication
         user => "user@company.com"
         # password => "your_password"
         api_token => "your_api_token"
         organizations => true
         users => true
         tickets => true
         tickets_last_updated_n_days_ago => 1
         comments => false
         append_comments_to_tickets => false
         topics => false
         sleep_between_runs => 30
       }
     }

    output 
    {
    	elasticsearch
        {
          index => "zd_%{type}"
          document_type => "%{type}"
          document_id => "%{id}"
          manage_template => false
          template_name => "zd_%{type}"
        }
    }
